                    Ever wondered when programs like Google APM, Facebook RMP, McKinsey's Analyst role, and Amazon's SDE open up? Number of spots per role? How to prepare specific to the company, rather than just
                    general prep? Find all of this and more here at Internship Timeline.

                    <div class="tangerine-text"> <b>How is this any different than Glassdoor, LinkedIn, or the company recruitment pages?</b></div>
                    <div class="home-text"> There are already countless job sites, books, articles, and videos on how to prepare for and land these amazing roles. 
                            You might ask, what does this site offer that different?
                            You have your resume proof-read, you've spent hours with your friends doing prep interviews, now you just have to apply.
                            However, you might be one of tens of thousands that apply to these prestigious internships, and after a week or two, it might be nearly impossible to have your application read out of the thousands that have already been submitted.
                            How can you ensure that you are among the first to apply and have your application read (if only for 15 seconds)?
                            That is the inspiration behind Internship Timeline. No one site has aggregated all of the information for new graduate and internship role release dates,
                            even for some of these very established programs. The purpose of this site is to list out critical information along with the release date of these roles for some of the most reputable roles in product management, consulting, software engineering, and finance.
