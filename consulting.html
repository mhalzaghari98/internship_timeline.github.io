                                Welcome to Internship Timeline. There are already hundreds of resources from books, blogs, videos, etc. that detail how to land great roles in software, 
                                finance, product, and consulting internships. You have your resume proof-read, you've spent hours with your friends doing prep interviews, now you just have to apply.
                                <br><br>
                                However, you might be one of tens of thousands that apply to these prestigious internships, and after a week or two, it might be nearly impossible to have your application read out of the thousands that have already been submitted.
                                <br><br>
                                How can you ensure that you are among the first to apply and have your application read (if only for 15 seconds)?
                                <br><br>
                                That is the inspiration behind Internship Timeline. No one site has aggregated all of the information for new graduate and internship role release dates,
                                even for some of these very established programs. The purpose of this site is to list out critical information along with the release date of these roles for some of the most reputable roles in product management, consulting, software engineering, and finance.
